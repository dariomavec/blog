<h1>The Forest</h1>
<p>Imagine with me a moment.</p>
<p>Youâ€™ve spent all day writing killer R code. It has been a blur of data munging, model tweaks and picture perfect analysis outputs, using test data.</p>
<p>The clock hits 6pm, and you set your code running against the full dataset. By your estimate, it should take about 8 hours to run. Perfect! You can start fresh in the morning with a big, strong coffee. Only when you start the next day, you discover that the job has failed. Worse than that, the application crashed so you canâ€™t even get any information on what caused the crash.</p>
<p>Uhohâ€¦ Time for a day of tinkering away at code, trying to figure out what went wrong. Maybe you make a few fixes and try again that night, only to discover it crashes <strong>again</strong>. At this point, you might as well swap the console for the 9-tails - it canâ€™t be more painful!</p>

<h1>Logs to the rescue! ðŸŒ²</h1>
<p>Using the excellent <a href="https://github.com/daroczig/logger">logger</a> package, we can gather way more information about our complex jobs plus have a bit of fun along the way.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (!require(&quot;logger&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;logger&quot;)
library(logger)</code></pre>
<p>Test some more code</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- function(y, z) {
  y + z
}</code></pre>
</div>
