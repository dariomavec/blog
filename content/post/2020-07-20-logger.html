<h1>The Forest</h1>
<p>Imagine with me a moment.</p>
<p>Youâ€™ve spent all day writing killer R code. It has been a blur of data munging, model tweaks and picture perfect analysis outputs, using test data.</p>
<p>The clock hits 6pm, and you set your code running against the full dataset. By your estimate, it should take about 8 hours to run. Perfect! You can start fresh in the morning with a big, strong coffee. Only when you start the next day, you discover that the job has failed. Worse than that, the application crashed so you canâ€™t even get any information on what caused the crash.</p>
<p>Uhohâ€¦ Time for a day of tinkering away at code, trying to figure out what went wrong. Maybe you make a few fixes and try again that night, only to discover it crashes <strong>again</strong>. At this point, you might as well swap the console for the 9-tails - it canâ€™t be any more painful!</p>

<h1>Logs to the rescue! ðŸŒ²</h1>
<p>Using the excellent <a href="https://github.com/daroczig/logger">logger</a> package, we can gather way more information about our jobs and make our lives a bit easier. Once loaded we can start using the suite of <code>log_*()</code> functions to track important steps in our functions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (!require(&quot;logger&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;logger&quot;)
library(logger)

log_debug(&quot;I&#39;m a sneaky little log&quot;)
log_success(&quot;I&#39;m a happy little log&quot;)
## SUCCESS [2020-07-24 12:24:58] I&#39;m a happy little log
log_info(&quot;I&#39;m a friendly little log&quot;)
## INFO [2020-07-24 12:24:58] I&#39;m a friendly little log
log_warn(&quot;I&#39;m a worrying little log&quot;)
## WARN [2020-07-24 12:24:58] I&#39;m a worrying little log
log_error(&quot;I&#39;m a scary little log&quot;)
## ERROR [2020-07-24 12:24:58] I&#39;m a scary little log
log_fatal(&quot;Uhoh! I&#39;m a dead little log&quot;)
## FATAL [2020-07-24 12:24:58] Uhoh! I&#39;m a dead little log</code></pre>
<p>Now you may be asking, why canâ€™t I just use <code>print()</code> or <code>message()</code> like I always have? Well Iâ€™m glad you asked! Let me show you the benefits.</p>
<p>First, the obvious stuff. Every messages now comes with a timestamp, which can be incredibly useful for identifying and improving slow code. We also have a bunch of different severity levels for the messages which allow us to be much more nuanced with our logging. I find it useful to use <code>log_debug()</code> as Iâ€™m developing and just go totally nuts with how many logs I include. By default these messages wonâ€™t appear, however by changing the log threshold we can see them:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>log_debug(&quot;You can&#39;t see me!&quot;)
log_threshold(DEBUG)
log_debug(&quot;Oh noes!&quot;)
## DEBUG [2020-07-24 12:24:58] Oh noes!</code></pre>
<div id="adding-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Adding Variables</h2>
<p>Now for some of the niftier features! The log functions come with <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/glue">glue</a> strings enabled by default. Glue adds Python-like string interpolation, which simply means we can refer to variables inside the string using <code>{}</code> marks. Anything inside of the brackets will get evaluated and, assuming its printable, added to the string.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in 1:3) {
 log_info(&quot;i = {i}&quot;) 
}
## INFO [2020-07-24 12:24:58] i = 1
## INFO [2020-07-24 12:24:58] i = 2
## INFO [2020-07-24 12:24:58] i = 3</code></pre>

<h2>Log to File</h2>
<p>Logging to console is all well and good, but in our starting example</p>
