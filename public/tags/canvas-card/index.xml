      <description>Bergdorf This was an interesting exercise as it was much more constructed than the last two cards. It is also the closest replication of Lukeâ€™s original card. The code for diamond and circle shapes may get re-used in the future.

      <description>Varsarely The first canvas card! It was fun experimenting with different ways of using ggplot to present a grid of squares. I settled on creating collections of points and using geom_polygon() to render them. This allows the use of standard tidyverse data operations when preparing the data, and should be a fairly powerful paradigm to work with going forward.
Definitely took a few attempts to correctly set up the matrix multiplication for the rotation transformations, but was a lot of fun seeing the visible impacts of my screw ups.</description>

      <description>Vertigo Since I already had done the work for generating squares and performing rotations, this card was pretty straightforward. It was a lot of fun playing with the different tweaking parameters to modify the feel of the spiral effect. Lots of future potential!
