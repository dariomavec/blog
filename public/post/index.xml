      <description>Vertigo Since I already had done the work for generating squares and performing rotations, this card was pretty straightforward. It was a lot of fun playing with the different tweaking parameters to modify the feel of the spiral effect. Lots of future potential!

      <description>Varsarely The first canvas card! It was fun experimenting with different ways of using ggplot to present a grid of squares. I settled on creating collections of points and using geom_polygon() to render them. This allows the use of standard tidyverse data operations when preparing the data, and should be a fairly powerful paradigm to work with going forward.
Definitely took a few attempts to correctly set up the matrix multiplication for the rotation transformations, but was a lot of fun seeing the visible impacts of my screw ups.</description>

      <description>Canvas Cards As a side project this year, I thought it would be fun to play around with making art in R. Because I’m not all that original, I will use an existing developer’s project as the guide for my development. In particular, Canvas Cards will be the basis of inspiration for each card.
To stop this from being a pure copy paste exercise, I want to establish some constraints for this project:</description>

      <description>The Forest Imagine with me a moment.
You’ve spent all day writing killer R code. It has been a blur of data munging, model tweaks and picture perfect analysis outputs, using test data.
The clock hits 6pm, and you set your code running against the full dataset. By your estimate, it should take about 8 hours to run. Perfect! You can start fresh in the morning with a big, strong coffee.</description>
